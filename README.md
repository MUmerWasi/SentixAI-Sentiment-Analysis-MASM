# SentixAI: Advanced Sentiment Analysis for Business Insights
**Introduction**
SentixAI is an innovative project that focuses on Sentiment Analysis, a subset of text analysis powered by Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms. It aims to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information expressed in text data. Sentiment Analysis plays a crucial role in understanding customer opinions and emotions, providing valuable insights for businesses to make data-driven decisions.

**Key Features**
  1.Polarity Classification: SentixAI classifies the polarity of expressed opinions into positive, negative, or neutral categories. By analyzing the sentiment of the text, businesses can understand the overall tone and perception of their products or services.
  2.Emotion Detection: Beyond polarity, SentixAI goes a step further by identifying emotional states expressed in the text. This feature provides a deeper understanding of customer sentiments, allowing businesses to tailor their strategies accordingly.
  3.Multi-Level Analysis: SentixAI offers three levels of sentiment analysis: Document-Level Analysis, which identifies emotions across the entire text; Topical Analysis, which matches sentiment to specific keywords or topics; and Aspect-Based Analysis, which provides a quantitative summary of sentiment expressed towards different aspects of a product or service.
